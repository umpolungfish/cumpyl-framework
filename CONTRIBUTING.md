### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

* Engage the community in working toward the best possible Cumpyl
* Enable a sustainable system for Cumpyl's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in the template
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all status checks are passing

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Python Styleguide

All Python code should follow PEP 8. We use `black` for code formatting and `flake8` for linting. Please ensure your code passes both before submitting a PR.

### Documentation Styleguide

* Use Markdown for documentation
* Use clear and descriptive language
* Include examples when possible
* Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
