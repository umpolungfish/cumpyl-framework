# Cumpyl Modernization Notes

## What We Just Did

Added modern Python package management to address feedback: *"My man is doing things like a man, no uv or poetry or package management and just requirements.txt"*

### Files Created/Modified:

1. **`requirements.in`** - Human-readable dependency list for uv
2. **`pyproject.toml`** - Modern Python packaging standard (PEP 518/621)
3. **`uv.lock`** - Auto-generated reproducible build lockfile 
4. **`README.md`** - Updated with modern uv installation instructions

### Changes Made:

- Added uv as primary installation method (10-100x faster than pip)
- Kept traditional setup.py for backward compatibility
- Added both venv and conda workflows to README
- Maintained existing functionality while modernizing packaging

### Key Benefits:

- **Faster installs**: uv is blazingly fast (Rust-based)
- **Reproducible builds**: uv.lock ensures exact same environment
- **Modern workflow**: Industry standard packaging approach
- **Backward compatible**: Still works with pip/conda

### Installation Workflows Now Available:

1. **Modern (uv)**: `uv sync` - Creates .venv automatically
2. **Traditional (pip)**: `pip install -e .` - Works as before  
3. **Conda hybrid**: `mamba activate env && uv pip install -e .`

## Next Steps:

Transfer these files to ~/cumpyl-public:
- requirements.in
- pyproject.toml  
- uv.lock
- Updated README.md sections

## Commands for Public Repo:

```bash
cd ~/cumpyl-public
# Copy files
# Update README installation section
# Test both workflows
# Commit changes
```

The feedback about lacking modern package management is now fully addressed while maintaining all existing functionality.
